We would greatly appreciate your contributions, ideas to improve or critical thoughts in the form of:

- Reporting bugs

- Raising and discussing concerns.

on Discord or via the Github issues.

## We Develop with Github
We use github to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## Want to add some code?
We use [Gitflow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow) for our code contribution. New branches should have
the feature/ or hotfix/ prefix, the issue number and title, for example: feature/smartcontract-code-coverage-#1
